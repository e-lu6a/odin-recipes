    <!-- recipe ingredients -->
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound whole wheat linguine</li>
      <li>1/3 cup olive oil</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste</li>
      <li>2 shallots, chopped</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
      <li>1/2 cup walnuts, chopped</li>
      <li>1/2 pound cooked ham, thinly sliced</li>

      <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- steps -->
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil
        over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the linguine, and
        return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until
        the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, 8 to 10
        minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.
      </li>

      <li>
        Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat, and cook and
        stir the garlic, shallots, and red pepper flakes until the garlic is
        fragrant but not browned, about 3 minutes. Stir in the walnuts, and cook
        until the nuts give off a toasted smell, about 2 minutes; stir in ham
        slices, and cook the mixture until the ham is hot and beginning to
        brown, about 5 more minutes.
      </li>

      <li>
        Lightly toss the pasta with the ham mixture in the skillet, and sprinkle
        with Parmesan cheese and parsley.
      </li>
