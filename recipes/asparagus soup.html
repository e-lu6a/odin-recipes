        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This soup is easy to make. Asparagus has a strong flavor by itself, so I chose to add a few mint leaves and lemon zest to give it a wonderfully fresh aroma!</p>
        
        <!-- ingredients -->
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound fresh asparagus, trimmed
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil
            <li>1 shallot, chopped
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint
            <li>sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
            <li>2 cups chicken stock, or more if needed
            <li>1 teaspoon lemon zest
            <li>1 hard-boiled egg, chopped
        </ul> 

        <!-- steps -->
        <h2>Steps</h2>  
        <ol>
            <li>Cut tips from 6 asparagus spears, about 1 1/2 inches from the top; reserve for garnish later. Chop the remaining asparagus into chunks.
            <li>Heat olive oil in a soup pot over medium heat; cook and stir shallot in the hot oil until softened, about 3 minutes. Add chopped asparagus; season with mint, salt, and pepper. Cook until asparagus are slightly tender, about 3 minutes.
            <li>Pour chicken stock into asparagus mixture; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until asparagus are tender, 12 to 15 minutes. Stir in lemon zest.
            <li>Blend soup using a hand blender or a food processor until smooth.
            <li>Bring a small pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook asparagus tips in the boiling water until just turning bright green, about 2 minutes. Strain asparagus tips and run under cold water to stop the cooking process. Garnish soup with asparagus tips and hard-boiled egg.
        </ol>
